Making your LIFX bulb smarter.

Currently only supports 1 bulb (as that's my personal setup).

## Setup
`python setup.py`

## About
I wanted to make my LIFX bulb smarter, such as a depth sensor switch attached to the side of my night stand instead of arguing with Amazon Alexa I said "lights off", not "define off". Plus I wanted to encode daily weather in colors + flashes when I have it turn on in the morning.

I'm running this off a Raspberry Pi, and might include ESP32 support in the future as my ESP8266 was giving me issues.

## TODO
- add IFTTT integration
- add depth sensor api
